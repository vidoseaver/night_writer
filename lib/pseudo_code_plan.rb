steps as imagined by vido

1st build a test for a class that breaks strings into arrays.

method should break should take two arguments. string and length.

also need to hard code two arrays with all the charctes both in text
and braille

combine to make a hash?

Im thinking keep seperate because then they be built into a hash as
needed and reversed

build method for reading a use by line. check for length, can use the
hack and slash method for output to text

every three lines we can split it by 2s then combine and to build our
braille letters

inuumberables agaisnt each six digit braille character to check against
regular charcters

case statements trickle down. start with caps, then do to regulargi
